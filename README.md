ColorPicker is a Swift app developed as part of the Apple Swift Explorations course, Unit 4: Building Apps. It's a color mixing application with additional features, including labels displaying float values for each color. This app serves as a practical introduction to iOS app development.

## Background

ColorPicker is a project in Apple's Develop in Swift courses. It's introduced in Unit 4
## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to learn  the process of app development, from inception to testing and completion. It offers hands-on experience in building user interfaces and connecting them to code through actions and outlets.

## Learning Goal

learn how to create user interfaces using Xcode's Interface Builder tools. They'll gain experience in creating outlets to access UI view properties and actions to respond to user interactions, all while building a color picker app.

## Getting Started

To see my results start by building and exploring ColorPicker, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the app using the iOS Simulator or your connected device.
4. Experiment with color mixing and float values.
